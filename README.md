 # Hangman Game 

![Home screen](./image.png)

## Nice Little Project
 => It's the **old creepy Hangman Game** .

Just for the record **I do not support** hanging people and i kinda detest the whole thing but,
pretty nice in terms of **SHARPENING** web Dev skills,
I used CSS3 (**no framework or library**) and Beloved **Vanilla JS** :)
